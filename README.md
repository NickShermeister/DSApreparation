I needed to relearn/make sure I remembered everything from Java for Data Structures and Algorithms in Spring 2018 at Olin. Therefore, I followed the book "Head-First Java‚Äù by Kathy Sierra & Bert Bates, and completed some exercises here. Not everything was done, but I did start simple (with a little sass). Overall, the book is good and I would recommend it.
